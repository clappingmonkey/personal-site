# iDroidBG project

The iDroidBG project contains a forum based on phpbb platform and a blog based on the ghost blogging platform. 

Six friends had the feeling that nowhere in the Bulgarian internet community the tech news were represented correctly and not biased for one reason or another so the idea for iDroidBG came. 

The phpbb 2.3.3 forum was installed and maintained on shared hosting at superhosting.bg firstly and then after year and a half migrated to vps. On the shared hosting the server was with the very typical LAMP stack(Ubuntu 16.04 running php7.2, MariaDB 10 and Apache2). During 

The Movies Project is something like **Netflix**, the only difference is that **it's not real**! It doesn't exist! I just created it to demonstrate how the **showcase** page looks like and how you can write whatever you want with full markdown support.
