** This is the project for my pesonal site. 

The site is maded with Jekyll based on the theme PersonalYOU that I moded and it's hosted on this repo and netlify.

The site cotains Projects portfolio page in wich are almost all projects that I made someting on. Articles page wich is sorta blog. I'm typing sorta because 90% of it contains mine posts but may and will contain olso posts-links to external sources. And the last page is About me. It contains the main skills that I have and timeline with my education and career choices and projects.
