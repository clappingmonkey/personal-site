## This is the project for my personal site. 

The site is made with Jekyll and based on the theme PersonalYOU that I modified and it's hosted on this repo and netlify.

The site contains Projects portfolio page in which are almost all projects that I made something on. A blog page with different posts almost entirely by me. I'm typing almost because 90% of it will contain mine posts but may and would contain also posts-links to external sources. And the last page is About me. It contains the main skills that I have  and developed through time and timeline with my education and career choices, projects and experience. 

**Everybody is completely free to use everything on the site and to use, edit or copy any part of it.**
