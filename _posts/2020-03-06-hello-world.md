## Hello, world.

This is my first blog post in my personal site. In this site you can find my resume and bio which includes my skills and experience through the years, my portfolio of different projects that I made or contributed till now, and a blog which obviously you already found. 

*A little about me:*

I'm Ventsi, a 29 years old male from Bulgaria. Currently, located in Sofia, the capital of the country. I have Bachelor degree of Computer Science of University of Rousse. Before the university I graduated with excellence technical high school Christo Botev with specialty Telecommunications technologies. 

In this blog there will be different sort of posts. Most of them, about 90% will be about something techie and now and then there will be some more personal post or something ‚Äúof the grid‚Äù.

Bye for now. ü§ìÔ∏è
